# Tasks: Blueprint

**Input**: Blueprint specification from `.xe/specs/blueprint/spec.md`
**Prerequisites**: Blueprint spec.md, plan.md, research.md

**Note**: This tasks.md represents the IMPLEMENTATION of all features defined in the blueprint, not the creation of the blueprint specification itself. The blueprint specification was completed during the Analysis and Specification phases. Implementation executes each feature using `/catalyst:run start-rollout {feature-id}`.

## Feature Implementation Status

Track the implementation status of all features defined in the blueprint. Update as features are completed via `/catalyst:run start-rollout {feature-id}`.

### Tier 0: Foundation
- [ ] T001: Implement `repository-structure` feature
- [ ] T002: Implement `init-issue-template` feature
- [ ] T003: Implement `agreement-guide` feature
- [ ] T004: Implement `agreement-template` feature

### Tier 1: Core Configuration
- [ ] T005: Implement `init-script` feature (includes startup-config schema)
- [ ] T006: Implement `agreement-content` feature (includes content snippets and section templates)
- [ ] T007: Implement `progress-tracking` feature

### Tier 2: Automation
- [ ] T008: Implement `init-workflow` feature
- [ ] T009: Implement `section-orchestration` feature

### Tier 3: Section Processing
- [ ] T010: Implement `section-script` feature
- [ ] T011: Implement `ai-guidance` feature
- [ ] T012: Implement `validation-system` feature

### Tier 4: Finalization
- [ ] T013: Implement `finalization-workflow` feature
- [ ] T014: Implement `export-system` feature
- [ ] T015: Implement `user-documentation` feature

## Dependencies

**Tier-based dependencies:**
- All Tier 0 features (T001-T004) can be implemented in parallel (no dependencies)
- Tier 1 features (T005-T007) depend on Tier 0 completion
- Tier 2 features (T008-T009) depend on Tier 1 completion
- Tier 3 features (T010-T012) depend on Tier 2 completion
- Tier 4 features (T013-T015) depend on Tier 3 completion

**Feature-specific dependencies:**
- T001 (`repository-structure`) blocks T005 (`init-script`) and T007 (`progress-tracking`)
- T002 (`init-issue-template`) blocks T005 (`init-script`)
- T003 (`agreement-guide`) blocks T006 (`agreement-content`)
- T004 (`agreement-template`) blocks T006 (`agreement-content`) and T010 (`section-script`)
- T007 (`progress-tracking`) blocks T005 (`init-script`), T008 (`init-workflow`), T009 (`section-orchestration`), T010 (`section-script`), and T013 (`finalization-workflow`)
- T005 (`init-script`) blocks T008 (`init-workflow`)
- T006 (`agreement-content`) blocks T010 (`section-script`)
- T008 (`init-workflow`) blocks T009 (`section-orchestration`)
- T009 (`section-orchestration`) blocks T010 (`section-script`)
- T010 (`section-script`) blocks T013 (`finalization-workflow`)
- T012 (`validation-system`) blocks T013 (`finalization-workflow`)
- T013 (`finalization-workflow`) blocks T014 (`export-system`)
- T014 (`export-system`) blocks T015 (`user-documentation`)

**Critical Path**: T001 → T007 → T005 → T008 → T009 → T010 → T013 → T014 → T015
