# Tasks: Blueprint

**Input**: Design documents from `.xe/specs/blueprint/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md

## Step 1: Setup

- [ ] T001: Create `.xe/specs/blueprint/` directory structure
- [ ] T002: Create placeholder files (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, research.md)

## Step 2: Research & Analysis

- [ ] T003: Read `.xe/product.md` for product vision and goals
- [ ] T004: Read `.xe/architecture.md` for technical constraints
- [ ] T005: Read `.xe/engineering.md` for design principles
- [ ] T006: Analyze blueprint description for product scope and requirements
- [ ] T007: Identify core user journeys (initialization, section completion, collaboration, finalization)
- [ ] T008: Extract core domain entities (Configuration Profile, Agreement Document, Content Snippet, etc.)
- [ ] T009: Document research findings in `research.md` with date

## Step 3: Feature Decomposition

- [ ] T010: Break product into discrete, implementable features following SOLID principles
- [ ] T011: Define feature scope descriptions (1-2 sentences each, clear and unambiguous)
- [ ] T012: Assign unique kebab-case IDs to all features
- [ ] T013: Ensure each feature has single responsibility and clear boundaries
- [ ] T014: Validate features are independently testable and implementable

## Step 4: Dependency Analysis

- [ ] T015: For each feature, identify prerequisite features
- [ ] T016: Build dependency relationship map
- [ ] T017: Validate no circular dependencies exist (use topological sort if needed)
- [ ] T018: Assign features to dependency tiers (Tier 0 = no dependencies, Tier N = depends on Tier 0 to N-1)
- [ ] T019: Group features by tier for parallelization opportunities

## Step 5: Estimation & Prioritization

- [ ] T020: Estimate complexity for each feature (Small: 1-3 days, Medium: 4-7 days, Large: 8+ days)
- [ ] T021: Assign priority numbers based on dependency order and business value
- [ ] T022: Within same tier, order by business value and risk reduction
- [ ] T023: Validate priority sequence respects dependencies

## Step 6: Dependency Graph Generation

- [ ] T024: Create mermaid diagram with all feature IDs as nodes
- [ ] T025: Add directed edges for all dependency relationships (A â†’ B means B depends on A)
- [ ] T026: Organize graph visually by tiers (top to bottom, Tier 0 at top)
- [ ] T027: Validate graph is acyclic (no cycles detected)
- [ ] T028: Ensure all features appear in graph

## Step 7: Populate Blueprint Specification

- [ ] T029: Create `spec.md` following `.xe/templates/specs/spec.md` structure
- [ ] T030: Add frontmatter with blueprint ID and metadata
- [ ] T031: Write Description section (product overview and blueprint purpose)
- [ ] T032: Add Core Entities section (domain concepts spanning multiple features)
- [ ] T033: Embed Feature Dependency Graph (mermaid diagram from T024-T028)
- [ ] T034: Add Features section header and tier headers (Tier 0, Tier 1, etc.)
- [ ] T035: Document all Tier 0 features with ID, dependencies, complexity, priority, scope, deliverables
- [ ] T036: Document all Tier 1 features with ID, dependencies, complexity, priority, scope, deliverables
- [ ] T037: Document all Tier 2 features with ID, dependencies, complexity, priority, scope, deliverables
- [ ] T038: Document all Tier 3 features with ID, dependencies, complexity, priority, scope, deliverables
- [ ] T039: Document all Tier 4 features with ID, dependencies, complexity, priority, scope, deliverables
- [ ] T040: Add Success Criteria section (measurable conditions for blueprint completeness)
- [ ] T041: Add Implementation Approach section (recommended feature order, parallelization, timeline)

## Step 8: Validation

- [ ] T042: Verify all features have unique kebab-case IDs
- [ ] T043: Verify all features have dependencies list (empty array if none)
- [ ] T044: Verify all features have complexity estimate (Small, Medium, or Large)
- [ ] T045: Verify all features have priority number
- [ ] T046: Verify all features have 1-2 sentence scope description
- [ ] T047: Verify dependency graph is present in spec.md
- [ ] T048: Verify dependency graph is acyclic (no circular dependencies)
- [ ] T049: Verify dependency graph includes all feature IDs
- [ ] T050: Verify features are correctly organized into numbered tiers
- [ ] T051: Verify success criteria are measurable and complete
- [ ] T052: Verify implementation approach is logical and respects dependencies

## Step 9: Documentation

- [ ] T053: Ensure `research.md` documents design decisions and rationale
- [ ] T054: Ensure `plan.md` describes blueprint generation methodology
- [ ] T055: Ensure `tasks.md` (this file) describes implementation steps
- [ ] T056: Cross-reference all documents for consistency

## Dependencies

**Sequential dependencies:**
- Step 1 (Setup) must complete before Step 2 (Research)
- Step 2 (Research) must complete before Step 3 (Feature Decomposition)
- Step 3 (Feature Decomposition) must complete before Step 4 (Dependency Analysis)
- Step 4 (Dependency Analysis) must complete before Step 5 (Estimation)
- Step 5 (Estimation) must complete before Step 6 (Dependency Graph)
- Step 6 (Dependency Graph) must complete before Step 7 (Populate Spec)
- Step 7 (Populate Spec) must complete before Step 8 (Validation)
- Step 8 (Validation) must complete before Step 9 (Documentation)

**Task-level dependencies:**
- T029 (Create spec.md) must complete before T030-T041 (populate sections)
- T024-T028 (Dependency Graph) must complete before T033 (embed graph in spec)
- T010-T014 (Feature Decomposition) must complete before T035-T039 (document features)
