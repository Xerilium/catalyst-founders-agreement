# Tasks: Blueprint

**Input**: Blueprint specification from `.xe/specs/blueprint/spec.md`
**Prerequisites**: Blueprint spec.md, plan.md, research.md

**Note**: This tasks.md represents the IMPLEMENTATION of all features defined in the blueprint, not the creation of the blueprint specification itself. The blueprint specification was completed during the Analysis and Specification phases. Implementation executes each feature using `/catalyst:run start-rollout {feature-id}`.

## Feature Implementation Status

Track the implementation status of all features defined in the blueprint. Update as features are completed via `/catalyst:run start-rollout {feature-id}`.

### Tier 0: Foundation
- [ ] T001: Implement `repository-structure` feature
- [ ] T002: Implement `init-issue-template` feature
- [ ] T003: Implement `agreement-template` feature

### Tier 1: Core Configuration
- [ ] T004: Implement `init-script` feature
- [ ] T005: Implement `progress-tracking` feature

### Tier 2: Automation
- [ ] T006: Implement `init-workflow` feature
- [ ] T007: Implement `section-orchestration` feature

### Tier 3: Section Processing
- [ ] T008: Implement `section-script` feature
- [ ] T009: Implement `ai-guidance` feature
- [ ] T010: Implement `validation-system` feature

### Tier 4: Finalization
- [ ] T011: Implement `finalization-workflow` feature
- [ ] T012: Implement `export-system` feature

## Dependencies

**Tier-based dependencies:**
- All Tier 0 features (T001-T003) can be implemented in parallel (no dependencies)
- Tier 1 features (T004-T005) depend on Tier 0 completion
- Tier 2 features (T006-T007) depend on Tier 1 completion
- Tier 3 features (T008-T010) depend on Tier 2 completion
- Tier 4 features (T011-T012) depend on Tier 3 completion

**Feature-specific dependencies:**
- T001 (`repository-structure`) blocks T004 (`init-script`) and T005 (`progress-tracking`)
- T002 (`init-issue-template`) blocks T004 (`init-script`)
- T003 (`agreement-template`) blocks T004 (`init-script`), T007 (`section-orchestration`), T008 (`section-script`), and T009 (`ai-guidance`)
- T005 (`progress-tracking`) blocks T004 (`init-script`), T006 (`init-workflow`), T007 (`section-orchestration`), T008 (`section-script`), and T011 (`finalization-workflow`)
- T004 (`init-script`) blocks T006 (`init-workflow`)
- T006 (`init-workflow`) blocks T007 (`section-orchestration`)
- T007 (`section-orchestration`) blocks T008 (`section-script`)
- T008 (`section-script`) blocks T011 (`finalization-workflow`)
- T010 (`validation-system`) blocks T011 (`finalization-workflow`)
- T011 (`finalization-workflow`) blocks T012 (`export-system`)

**Critical Path**: T001 → T005 → T004 → T006 → T007 → T008 → T011 → T012
