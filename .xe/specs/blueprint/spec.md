# Blueprint: Catalyst Founders Agreement

## Description

This blueprint defines the complete feature roadmap for the Catalyst Founders Agreement productâ€”a GitHub template repository that automates the creation of structured founders agreements through AI-assisted, version-controlled collaboration.

The product transforms complex legal document creation into a guided, collaborative workflow where founders answer configuration questions, AI generates contextually appropriate content, and founders iteratively refine sections until consensus is reached. The final output is a professional PDF.

## Core Entities

**Configuration Profile**
- Startup type, funding intent, contribution balance, time commitment
- Equity flexibility, studio involvement, open source focus, investment avoidance, team size
- Stored as structured JSON, drives all downstream content generation

**Agreement Document**
- Markdown-based structured document with discrete sections
- Version-controlled with full audit trail
- Exports to PDF for legal review

**Content Snippet**
- Predefined content blocks for specific configuration combinations
- Organized by section and option
- Enables deterministic, repeatable agreement generation

**Section**
- Individual agreement component (equity split, vesting, IP assignment, governance, etc.)
- Completed independently via dedicated issue/PR workflow
- Tracks completion status

**Issue Template**
- Structured form for initialization and section completion
- Contains explicit instructions for AI execution
- Includes validation requirements

**GitHub Workflow**
- Event-driven automation for initialization, orchestration, finalization
- Triggered by issue creation, file updates, section completion
- Orchestrates multi-step processes

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All features documented with unique IDs
- [ ] Feature dependency graph is acyclic and correctly represents dependencies
- [ ] Features are organized into 5 dependency tiers
- [ ] Each feature has scope description (1-2 sentences)
- [ ] Each feature has complexity estimate (Small, Medium, Large)
- [ ] Each feature has priority order number
- [ ] All features align with product vision in `.xe/product.md`
- [ ] Blueprint enables implementation of complete Catalyst Founders Agreement product

## Implementation Approach

Features will be implemented using `/catalyst:run start-rollout {feature-id}` for each feature in dependency order. Features within the same tier can be implemented in parallel if multiple developers are available.

**Recommended Implementation Order**:
1. Tier 0 features (parallel): repository-structure, init-issue-template, agreement-guide, agreement-template
2. Tier 1 features (sequential): startup-config-schema â†’ init-script, then content-snippets
3. Tier 2 features (sequential): init-workflow â†’ section-orchestration â†’ section-templates
4. Tier 3 features (parallel): section-script, ai-guidance, validation-system
5. Tier 4 features (sequential): finalization-workflow â†’ export-system â†’ progress-tracking â†’ user-documentation

Total estimated timeline: 12-18 weeks with 1 full-time developer, 6-9 weeks with 2 developers working in parallel on independent tiers.
