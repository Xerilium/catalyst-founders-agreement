# Blueprint: Catalyst Founders Agreement

## Description

This blueprint defines the complete feature roadmap for the Catalyst Founders Agreement productâ€”a GitHub template repository that automates the creation of structured founders agreements through AI-assisted, version-controlled collaboration.

The product transforms complex legal document creation into a guided, collaborative workflow where founders answer configuration questions, AI generates contextually appropriate content, and founders iteratively refine sections until consensus is reached. The final output is a professional PDF.

## Core Entities

**Configuration Profile**
- Startup type, funding intent, contribution balance, time commitment
- Equity flexibility, studio involvement, open source focus, investment avoidance, team size
- Stored as structured JSON, drives all downstream content generation

**Agreement Document**
- Markdown-based structured document with discrete sections
- Version-controlled with full audit trail
- Exports to PDF for legal review

**Content Snippet**
- Predefined content blocks for specific configuration combinations
- Organized by section and option
- Enables deterministic, repeatable agreement generation

**Section**
- Individual agreement component (equity split, vesting, IP assignment, governance, etc.)
- Completed independently via dedicated issue/PR workflow
- Tracks completion status

**Issue Template**
- Structured form for initialization and section completion
- Contains explicit instructions for AI execution
- Includes validation requirements

**GitHub Workflow**
- Event-driven automation for initialization, orchestration, finalization
- Triggered by issue creation, file updates, section completion
- Orchestrates multi-step processes

   - `README.md` - Repository overview

2. **GitHub Repository Configuration**:
   - Enable template repository flag
   - Configure branch protection for main branch
   - Set up required status checks

3. **GitHub Labels**:
   - Create labels for issue categorization and workflow automation
   - Labels will support section tracking and status management

#### Feature 2: init-issue-template
**ID**: `init-issue-template`
**Dependencies**: None

**Scope**: Create GitHub issue form template with 8 configuration questions, each with dropdown options and clear descriptions. Template includes explicit instructions for AI on how to process responses and which script to execute.

**Questions** (each with 3 options + "Undecided"):

1. **Funding Intent**: How do you plan to fund the company?
   - Bootstrap - No external funding planned
   - Raise Capital - Plan to raise VC/angel funding
   - Undecided - Haven't decided yet

2. **Contribution Balance**: Are founder contributions expected to be equal or unequal?
   - Equal - All founders contribute equally
   - Weighted - Contributions vary by role/time/capital
   - Undecided - Haven't decided yet

3. **Time Commitment**: Will all founders work full-time?
   - Full-Time - All founders fully committed
   - Mixed - Some full-time, some part-time
   - Undecided - Haven't decided yet

4. **Equity Flexibility**: How flexible should equity splits be over time?
   - Fixed - Equity locked at founding
   - Dynamic - Equity adjusts based on contribution
   - Undecided - Haven't decided yet

5. **Studio Involvement**: Is a studio or parent company involved?
   - Yes - Studio/parent company involved
   - No - Independent startup
   - Undecided - Haven't decided yet

6. **Open Source Focus**: Will the product be open source?

- Load configuration from settings file
- Determine which snippets to use based on configuration
- Assemble section content from snippets
- Insert section content into correct location in agreement

**Instruction Areas**:
- How to interpret founder questions
- When to reference configuration guide documentation
- Tone and style (collaborative, educational, non-legal-advice disclaimer)
- How to explain tradeoffs between options
- When to suggest alternatives
- How to handle ambiguous requests
