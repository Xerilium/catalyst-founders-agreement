# Playbook: Start Rollout (single agent workflow)

## Description

Orchestrates feature development following the development process defined in `.xe/process/development.md`. Supports both manual execution (with human checkpoints) and autonomous execution (auto-proceed through phases).

## Inputs

- `feature-description` (optional) - Description of the feature to implement. If not provided, system will identify next high-priority feature.
- `rollout-id` (optional) - Short kebab-cased identifier for the rollout. If not provided, system will determine from feature.
- `execution-mode` (optional) - Execution approach: "manual" (human checkpoints) or "autonomous" (auto-proceed). Defaults to "manual".

## Outputs

- Feature branch at `xe/{username}/{rollout-id}`
- Feature specification at `.xe/specs/{feature-id}/spec.md`
- Implementation plan at `.xe/specs/{feature-id}/plan.md`
- Task breakdown at `.xe/specs/{feature-id}/tasks.md`
- Engineering research at `.xe/specs/{feature-id}/research.md`
- Pull request for code review and merge

## 1. Validate inputs

- If `feature-description` provided, validate it's a non-empty string
- If `rollout-id` provided, validate kebab-case pattern
- If `execution-mode` provided, validate it matches allowed values: "manual" or "autonomous"
- All validations are soft - system will auto-correct or prompt for clarification

## 2. Initialize

**Context Loading:**

- Read `.xe/process/development.md` for workflow phases
- Read `.xe/product.md` for product context
- Scan `.xe/specs/` directory for existing features

**Token Budget Warning:**

- Subagent context strictly limited to 1-2K tokens
- Pass only essential excerpts, never full files
- Smart budget management with progress tracking

## 3. Research

### Development Process Phase 1a: Analysis üî¨

- Review product & architecture context
- Conduct market research if new feature or major enhancement
- Analyze feature requirements & source code
- **Technical Debt Assessment:**
  - Identify technical debt and cleanup opportunities relevant to current task
  - Assess implementation scope: How much additional work to include cleanup?
  - Evaluate risk vs. benefit: Does cleanup justify increased complexity?
  - Determine rollout strategy: Should debt cleanup be pre-implementation, during, or post-implementation?
- Document findings in `.xe/specs/{feature-id}/research.md`

## 4. Execute

### Development Process Phase 0: Setup üõ†Ô∏è

1. Determine rollout ID from feature description
2. Create feature branch: `xe/{username}/{rollout-id}`
3. Create placeholder rollout plan at `.xe/rollouts/rollout-{rollout-id}.md`
4. Add entry to `.xe/rollouts/README.md` index

### Development Process Phase 2: Specification Development üìù

1. Create `.xe/specs/{feature-id}/spec.md` from template
2. Define WHAT and WHY (user value, business needs), not HOW
3. Write for non-technical stakeholders and AI code generation
4. Define platform/integration requirements, not technology constraints
5. Ensure requirements are testable and success criteria measurable
6. Incorporate technical debt assessment from Phase 1a into specification
7. **Human Checkpoint** ‚Üí Present specification for review:

   |    #     | Option                     | Notes                               |
   | :------: | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
   | üîµ **A** | **Continue (review plan)** | Proceed to planning phase           |
   | üü¢ **B** | **Change specification**   | Describe what to change             |
   | üü£ **Z** | **Continue autonomously**  | Auto-approve plan and proceed to PR |

   **Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding**

### Development Process Phase 3: Planning üèóÔ∏è

1. Research & Design Decisions ‚Üí Document in `research.md`
2. Data Model ‚Üí Define entities (inline in plan.md or separate data-model.md)
3. Contracts ‚Üí Define function signatures/APIs and generate contract tests
4. Implementation Approach ‚Üí Create `plan.md` with algorithms and integration
5. Usage Examples ‚Üí Document consumption patterns
6. Task Breakdown ‚Üí Create `tasks.md` with implementation steps
7. Rollout Orchestration ‚Üí Update rollout plan with pre/post/cleanup actions
8. **Human Approval Checkpoint (if not running autonomously)** ‚Üí Present Data Model, Contracts, and Implementation Approach for review:

   |    #     | Option          | Notes                           |
   | :------: | --------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | üîµ **A** | **Continue**    | Proceed to implementation phase |
   | üü¢ **B** | **Change plan** | Describe what to change         |

   **Wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding**

### Development Process Phase 4: Implementation Execution üöÄ

1. Load implementation context:
   - Read `.xe/engineering.md` for engineering principles
   - Read `.xe/architecture.md` for system architecture
   - Read `.xe/standards/` for code standards
2. Execute pre-implementation actions (if any in rollout plan)
3. Execute `.xe/specs/{feature-id}/tasks.md` implementation checklist
4. Execute post-implementation actions (if any in rollout plan)
5. Complete immediate cleanup actions
6. Delete rollout plan file when complete
7. Remove entry from `.xe/rollouts/README.md`

## 5. Verify

Run validation checks per `.xe/engineering.md` quality standards and verify all items in Success Criteria section below are met.

## 6. Request review

1. Create pull request into default branch
2. Set title: `[Catalyst][{type}] {feature-name}` where type is "Feature" or "Bug"
3. Summarize feature/bug in body description
4. Link related issues with `Fixes #{id}` or `Related to #{id}`
5. Assign reviewers per `.xe/product.md` team roles if defined (both human and AI reviewers)

## 7. Publish

Post PR comment with:

- Links to spec, plan, tasks, and research docs
- Summary of changes and next steps
- Notes on technical debt cleanup completed (if applicable)

## Error handling

**Implementation Failures:**

- If implementation task fails: preserve completed work, document blocker in rollout plan
- Escalate to human review if blocker cannot be resolved

**Plan Changes During Implementation:**

- Stop current implementation immediately if plan becomes invalid
- Document what was completed and what needs modification in rollout plan under "Changes Log"
- Never deviate from approved plan without user consent

**Rollback Procedures:**

- Clean up partial files if user cancels during implementation
- Document what was attempted in rollout plan or PR comment

**Context/Dependency Issues:**

- If required files missing (templates, architecture docs), halt and notify user
- If external dependencies unavailable, document blocker in rollout plan and suggest alternatives
- If merge conflicts detected, resolve or escalate to human review
