# Rollout: blueprint

This rollout orchestrates the implementation of all features defined in the Catalyst Founders Agreement product blueprint.

## Pre-implementation

None - The blueprint specification has been completed in the Analysis and Specification phases.

## Implementation

- [ ] Complete [.xe/specs/blueprint/tasks.md](../specs/blueprint/tasks.md)

**Note**: The blueprint tasks.md contains the implementation tasks for all features in the blueprint. Each task represents implementing a complete feature via `/catalyst:run start-rollout {feature-id}`. Track progress directly in tasks.md.

## Post-implementation

None - All features are independently implemented with their own rollout plans.

## Cleanup

- [ ] Remove entry from `.xe/rollouts/README.md` when all features complete
- [ ] Delete this rollout file after all features are implemented

---

**Note**: This rollout plan is kept active until all blueprint features are implemented. Only delete when all tasks in `.xe/specs/blueprint/tasks.md` are checked off as complete.
