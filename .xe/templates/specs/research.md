# Research: {feature-name}

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Create a focused research document that captures product context, market/competitive analysis (if applicable), technical discovery, and open questions. This file should be dated and authored. Keep findings factual and cite sources. Remove instruction blocks when complete.

## Summary

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> One-paragraph summary of the research findings and their implications for the feature.

## Scope

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Describe what was investigated (product area, code paths, integrations) and explicitly call out what is out-of-scope for this research pass.

## Methods

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Briefly describe how research was performed (code review, docs, interviews, web research, prototyping, experiments).

## Sources

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> List primary sources (URLs, internal docs, meeting notes) with short annotations and dates.

- Example: [Internal Design Doc](../designs/xyz.md) - notes from design review (2025-08-20)

## Technical Context

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Document the current code paths, component owners, relevant files, and any integration points discovered. Include suggested low-risk refactors or reuse opportunities.

## Migration / Compatibility Considerations

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Describe any data migrations, backward-compatibility concerns, or versioning impacts. If migrations are required, outline an approach and estimated effort.

## Open Questions

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
