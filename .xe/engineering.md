# Engineering Guidelines

## Core Principles

- **KISS**: Simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones, avoid premature optimization
- **YAGNI**: Build only what is needed, avoid implementing features "just in case"
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic organized by purpose, components have single responsibilities
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles exactly one well-defined function
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification via configuration and composition
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Principle of Least Astonishment**: Behavior matches user expectations, consistent patterns
- **DRY**: Single source of truth, no duplication of logic or configuration
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report errors immediately with clear, actionable messages
- **Design for Testability**: Easy to test and validate, comprehensive coverage
- **Deterministic Processing**: Consistent, predictable output for identical inputs

## Technical Standards

See `.xe/standards/` for language-specific coding standards and conventions.

- **Architecture**
  - Clear directory organization
  - Standardized naming conventions
  - Reusable, modular features and components
  - Platform-native patterns

- **Collaboration**
  - Multi-user simultaneous participation
  - Transparent decision tracking
  - Clear conflict resolution
  - Version-controlled audit trails

- **User Experience**
  - Minimize technical barriers
  - Clear progress indicators
  - Professional output quality
  - Accessible to non-technical users

- **Reliability**
  - Robust error handling and recovery
  - Data validation at each step
  - Consistent state management
  - Reproducible results

- **Quality**
  - 90% code coverage target for all features
  - 100% coverage for critical paths and error handling
  - Complete specifications and implementation plans
  - Clear documentation for complex logic and architectural decisions

## Development Process

See `.xe/process/development.md` for the complete Spec-Plan-Code-Test workflow and implementation process.
